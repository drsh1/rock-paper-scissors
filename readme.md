# Rock Paper Scissors Game

A simple web implementation of classic Rock Paper Scissors Game created as a task for The Odin Project (<https://www.theodinproject.com/>).

The idea is to find out user's game choice when he/she clicks on one of 3 buttons representing possible options. Then, based on the randomly generated computer's selection,  the outcome of the game is determined and all the necessary information is printed on the page.

TO DO:

* add some CSS styling

* add RESTART button
